        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hello My name is Edward Chan and I am a student studying Business at the University of California, Riverside. Right now I am trying to specialize in finance with the ultimate goal of landing a job as a financial analyst as I want to help my clients generate wealth through market analysis. Currently I have work experience as a receptionist at a front desk of a optometry and also work at the school's dining hall. I have a broad range of skills which include being bilingual with fluency in English and conversational Chinese and Cantonese. I also have leadership and communication skills from my time in the police explorers academy.  I have experience with sales, cashiering, filing paperwork and dealing with insurance claims. My education includes a high school diploma from Rosemead high school located in rosemead california and currently attending University of California, Riverside as a business major.  <br><br>

        Currently, I am working towards a Coursera certificate from Rice university in portfolio management to further my education on the field of finance. I hope to bring my experiences from this course into the work place. Furthermore, I currently have a GPA of 3.7 with completiion in courses like calculus for business micro and macro economics. I am a hardworking college student with a willingness to learn and I am trying to aim for a position as a finance intern that will allow me to get hands on experience with research and performing due dilligence on investments.   <br><br>

        Skills that I can bring to the table are analytical skills which is cruicial for finding investment oppurtunities to help clients build their portfolios and wealth. Furthermore, I have communication skills which I have developed through training in the police explorer academy. with my communication skills I can better explin to clients my investment recommendations and how it will help them build their portfolio. Laastly, I can also bring about decision making skills which is also important in the finance field as it will affect important choices you will make during investing like when to buy or sell and hold. In addition to that it is also important when performing market research and due dillgence as you need to make the decision on whether a certain investment will really be able to get a return. While being an intern I will also be able to bring about valuable insight from my previous investment experiences managing my parents portfolios and even my own personal finance and retiremnt accounts. With my father's account I was able to return 50% of his investments with swing trading over a 1 month period trading penny stocks and momentum trading. I am not new to the stock market and have had many experiences with stock trading and I hope to bring my knowledge as well gain more knowldeg to be able to help clients with thier investments. Also I plan on pursuing a Financial industry regulatory authority licensing in order to fill certain finance roles that companies may be looking for. Further down the line I also plan on being chartered Financial analyst certified in order to bring increased crediability to my financial recommendation
